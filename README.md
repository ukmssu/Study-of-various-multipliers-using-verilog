# Study of various multipliers using verilog
Understanding logic behind each one Multipliers: Array Multiplier, Booth Multiplier, Baugh-Wooley Multiplier and Wallace Multiplier. Implementing each one multiplier using verilog.

## Abstract
In modern high-speed Digital Signal Processing, Speech recognition and other applications, multipliers are critical components. Multiplication of two binary numbers is a fundamental and commonly used arithmetic operation. The objective of this paper is to examine the principles behind four different kind of multipliers: Array multiplier, Booth multiplier, Baugh-Wooley multiplier, and Wallace tree multiplier. Additionally, this paper includes the implementation of each multiplier using Verilog HDL in Xilinx Vivado 2020.2.

KEYWORDS: Array multiplier; Booth multiplier; Baugh-Wooley multiplier; Wallace tree multiplier; Verilog HDL.

## Objective of the Work
The main objectives of this project are:-


• Understanding logic behind each one multiplier.

– Array multiplier.

– Booth multiplier.

– Baugh-Wooley multiplier.

– Wallace multiplier.

• Understanding different techniques to reduce the latency of all these multipliers.

• Implementing these multipliers for binary number system in xilinx Vivado using verilog HDL.

• Performing the delay and area analysis of these multipliers.

## Conclusion
In this report I have implemented the different types of multipliers include Array multiplier, Booth multiplier, Baugh-Wooley multiplier, and Wallace multiplier. From these 4 multipliers Array multiplier and Booth multiplier are implemented in 64x64 bit in xilinx vivado 2020.2 using Verilog HDL. Baugh-Wooley is impleted in 8x8 bit and Wallace Tree multiplier is implemented in 4x4 bit in xilinx vivado 2020.2 using Verilog HDL.
